Progressive Web Apps (PWA) are reliable, fast, and engaging.

- Workbox - Registers a service worker for offline caching.
- Manifest - Automatically generate manifest.json file.
- Meta - Automatically adds SEO friendly meta data with manifest integration.
- Icon - Automatically generates app icons with different sizes.
- OneSignal - Free background push notifications using OneSignal.

For more info on installing a Nuxt PWA see the [docs](https://pwa.nuxtjs.org/setup.html).

For this site we have setup the PWA therefore it will work offline once of course it has been cached and it can also be saved to the home screen giving it the look and feel of a real app.
